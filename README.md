## Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run with default configuration
python run.py

# Run with custom configuration
python run.py -config Configs/LGP1/I107.ini

# Run with specific seed for reproducibility
python run.py -seed 42 -generations 100
```

### Validate Configuration
```bash
# Test configuration files before running full experiments
python run.py -validateConfig Configs/LGP1/
```

### Analyze Results
```bash
# Analyze the best evolved model
python run.py -analyze Output/best.sgp

# Test model with manual inputs
python run.py -test_model Output/best.sgp
```

Additional information regarding the theoretical aspects of this project will be available as soon as it is published.

## Current State

### Implementation
The code base in this repository represents a prototype of the Spatial Genetic Programming (SGP) system. Ongoing work includes:
- Parallelizing the algorithm.
- Refining the system to function more effectively as a framework.

### Features and Research
Current research and development efforts focus on:
- Implementing Neural Network nodes to replace the underlying Linear Genetic Programming (LGP) structures.
- Enhancing performance through neuro-evolution (NE).

The NE-SGP code will be linked here once it is made publicly available.
