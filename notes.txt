- Think about the idea of shapes for program nodes. e.g. circular, rectangular etc                                      !!
- Think about initialization types of the nodes/LGPs. Grow, Half and half, full etc                                     !!
- We can create spatial conditions with RetCons                                                                         !!!!!
- One thing I don't particularly love about this system is how the non-discrete outputs are determined                  !
- Determining the inputs and outputs in the fitness file                                                                !!!!
